"A book which is no longer
discussed today":
Tran Duc Thao, Jacques Derrida,
and Maurice Merleau-Ponty
Tim Herrick
This article argues that while Jacques Derrida's autobiographical locations
of himself within a philosophical tradition, and particularly his public thesis
defense at the Sorbonne in 1980, form a helpful reminder of his intellectual
background, they cannot be taken entirely at face value.' In the defense of a
selection of his work submitted to the Sorbonne, Derrida acknowledges the
importance of Husserlian phenomenology both for his philosophically forma-
tive years of the 1950s and for the time of writing. He calls Husserlian phenom-
enology "a discipline of incomparable rigour," although he carefully qualifies
the discipline he has in mind:
Not especially not-in the versions proposed by Sartre or by Merleau-
Ponty which were then dominant, but rather in opposition to them, or
without them, in particular in those areas which a certain type of French
phenomenology appeared at times to avoid, whether in history, in sci-
ence, in the historicity of seience, the history of ideal objects and of
truth, and hence in politics as well, and even in ethics. I should like to
recall here, as one indication among others, a book which is no longer
discussed today, a book whose merits can be very diversely evaluated,
but which for a certain number of us pointed to a task, a difficulty and
no doubt an impasse. This is Tran Duc Thao's Phénoménologie et
matérialisme dialectique?
